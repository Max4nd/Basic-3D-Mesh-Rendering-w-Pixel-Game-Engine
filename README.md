# Basic-3D-Mesh-Rendering-w-Pixel-Game-Engine
A basic mesh render of a teapot read from an object file, made with the OLC Pixel Game Engine.

An amalgamation of of few things learned in javidx9 3D graphics engine.
All the maths was taken from these videos.

Originally included a tempated vector3D class, but didnt make a whole lotta sense in this application so I scrapped and replaced it with the simpler vecf3D class (struct).

I think this is a good intro, I would like to delve deeper into the graphics engine world but that would lead to learning more maths instead of C++.
